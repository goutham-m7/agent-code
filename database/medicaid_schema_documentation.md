# üè• **Medicaid Database Schema Documentation**

## üìã **Overview**

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) database schema. The system manages claims, payments, pricing, and rebate calculations for Medicaid drug programs across different states and quarters.

## üèóÔ∏è **Database Architecture**

The database follows a **claim-centric architecture** where:
- **Claims** represent individual drug rebate requests
- **Claim Lines** contain specific drug and pricing information
- **Payments** track rebate disbursements
- **Programs** define rebate calculation rules and formulas
- **Validation** ensures data quality and business rule compliance

## üìä **Core Tables**

## üéØ **URA Calculation Process**

### **1. Data Collection**
- Collect invoice data (units, amounts)
- Identify applicable URA pricing
- Determine calculation quarter

### **2. URA Calculation**
- Apply program-specific formulas
- Consider drug type (brand vs. generic)
- Apply CPI adjustments if applicable
- Calculate rebate amounts

### **3. Validation**
- Check against business rules
- Validate unit tolerances
- Ensure formula compliance
- Generate validation messages

### **4. Payment Processing**
- Aggregate rebates from claims
- Apply available credits
- Calculate interest on overdue amounts
- Process payments

## üìä **Data Quality Considerations**

### **Critical Fields**
- **URA amounts**: Must be accurate for rebate calculations
- **Units**: Must match invoice and payment records
- **Dates**: Must be within valid program periods
- **Status fields**: Must reflect current state accurately

### **Validation Rules**
- **Business rule compliance**: All claims must follow program rules
- **Data consistency**: Related fields must be consistent
- **Tolerance checking**: Amounts must be within acceptable ranges
- **Audit trail**: All changes must be tracked

## üîç **Common Query Patterns**

### **1. URA Discrepancy Analysis**
```sql
-- Find claims with URA discrepancies
SELECT 
    cl.MCD_CLAIM_LINE_ID,
    cl.SYS_CALC_URA,
    cl.INV_URA,
    ABS(cl.SYS_CALC_URA - cl.INV_URA) as URA_DIFFERENCE,
    c.CLAIM_STATUS,
    c.ORIG_QTR
FROM MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE cl
JOIN MN_MCD_CLAIM c ON cl.CLAIM_ID = c.MCD_CLAIM_ID
WHERE ABS(cl.SYS_CALC_URA - cl.INV_URA) > tolerance_threshold
```

### **2. Payment Analysis**
```sql
-- Analyze payment patterns by state and quarter
SELECT 
    c.STATE,
    c.ORIG_QTR,
    SUM(cl.REBATE_DUE) as TOTAL_REBATE_DUE,
    COUNT(*) as CLAIM_COUNT
FROM MN_MCD_CLAIM c
JOIN MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE cl ON c.MCD_CLAIM_ID = cl.CLAIM_ID
GROUP BY c.STATE, c.ORIG_QTR
ORDER BY c.ORIG_QTR DESC, c.STATE
```

### **3. Validation Issues**
```sql
-- Find validation issues by severity
SELECT 
    vm.SEVERITY,
    vm.VALIDATION_CLASS_NAME,
    COUNT(*) as ISSUE_COUNT
FROM MN_MCD_VALIDATION_MSG vm
JOIN MN_MCD_CLAIM_LINE cl ON vm.CLAIM_LINE_ID = cl.MCD_CLAIM_LINE_ID
WHERE vm.SEVERITY IN ('ERROR', 'WARNING')
GROUP BY vm.SEVERITY, vm.VALIDATION_CLASS_NAME
ORDER BY vm.SEVERITY, ISSUE_COUNT DESC
```

## üö® **Business Rules and Constraints**

### **1. Claim Processing Rules**
- Claims must be associated with valid programs
- Claim lines must have valid URA amounts
- Units must be within acceptable tolerance ranges
- All required fields must be populated

### **2. Payment Rules**
- Payments can only be processed for approved claims
- Credits must be applied before payment processing
- Interest calculations must follow state-specific rules
- Payment amounts must match claim totals

### **3. Validation Rules**
- Business rule violations must be resolved before approval
- Formula calculations must be validated
- Data quality checks must pass
- Audit requirements must be met

## üìà **Performance Considerations**

### **Indexing Strategy**
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for joins
- Composite indexes on frequently queried combinations
- Date-based indexes for time-series queries

### **Partitioning**
- Consider partitioning by quarter for large tables
- Partition by state for state-specific queries
- Archive old data to improve performance

### **Query Optimization**
- Use appropriate join strategies
- Leverage materialized views for complex calculations
- Implement query result caching where appropriate
